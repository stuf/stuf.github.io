## Control structures

### if-then[-else]

The classical `if-then` and `if-then-else` syntax does not apply with streams, since we're not comparing ordinary Javascript values.

Depending on where you're doing this, you have a few options. The "vanilla" and "native" reactive way is to `map` over values and use `skipWhile`. However, if you're working in the VDOM, you have some other options with `karet.util`.

#### Everywhere

```js
const value = U.constant(123); // put 123 into stream

const fooIfTrue = value.skipWhile(x => x !== 123); // ignore any values not 123

const foobarIfFoo = fooIfTrue.map(x => x + 'bar');

foobarIfFoo.log(); // logs '123bar'
```
